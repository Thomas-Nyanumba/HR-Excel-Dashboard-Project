# HR Analytics Dashboard Project

## Introduction
During my participation in the Analytics Extra Mentorship Program, I developed an interactive HR analytics dashboard as part of a hands-on learning project. The dashboard leverages data analysis techniques to extract actionable insights from HR data, offering stakeholders a clear view of workforce dynamics.

🔗 Key Highlights:

Data was cleaned using Power Query.
Analysis involved Pivot Tables, Charts, and calculated metrics.
An interactive Excel dashboard showcased the results visually.

❓ Problem Statement
Human Resources teams often struggle to monitor and analyze workforce trends efficiently. This project addressed these challenges by:

Identifying trends in employee retention, satisfaction, and salaries.
Visualizing workforce data to support HR decision-making.
Providing interactive tools to explore insights by department, employment type, and time period.
🧠 Skills Demonstrated
Data Cleaning & Transformation: Power Query was used to preprocess the dataset, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
Data Analysis Techniques: Pivot Tables and Charts were used to summarize data effectively.
Interactive Dashboard Design: Designed a user-friendly dashboard for filtering and visual exploration.
Storytelling with Data: Conveyed insights with visually appealing and intuitive charts.
📊 Data Overview
The dataset comprised over 30 fields, including:

Employee Demographics: id_employee, age, gender, marital status.
Job Details: job role, department, years at company.
Compensation: salary, hourly rate, percent salary hike.
Performance and Satisfaction: job satisfaction, work-life balance.
Tenure and Attrition: attrition, termination type, years since last promotion.
🔑 Key Questions Addressed
This project explored 15 critical HR questions, including:
1️⃣ Employee Statistics: Total employees, current employees, terminated employees, and termination rate.
2️⃣ Salary Insights: Total salary paid and trends in salary distribution.
3️⃣ Employee Dynamics: New hires, terminations (quarterly and monthly).
4️⃣ Satisfaction Metrics: Job satisfaction and work-life balance by headcount.
5️⃣ Demographic Analysis: Gender distribution and educational qualifications.

🌈 Visuals Used
Below are the key visuals incorporated into the dashboard:

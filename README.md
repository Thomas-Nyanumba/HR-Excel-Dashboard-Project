## Introduction
During my participation in the **Analytics Extra Mentorship Program**, I developed an interactive HR analytics dashboard as part of a hands-on learning project. The dashboard leverages data analysis techniques to extract actionable insights from HR data, offering stakeholders a clear view of workforce dynamics.

## Key Highlights

1. Data was cleaned using Power Query.
2. Analysis involved Pivot Tables, Charts, and calculated metrics.
3. An interactive Excel dashboard showcased the results visually.

## Problem Statement
Human Resources teams often struggle to monitor and analyze workforce trends efficiently. This project addressed these challenges by:

1. Identifying trends in employee retention, satisfaction, and salaries.
2. Visualizing workforce data to support HR decision-making.
3. Providing interactive tools to explore insights by department, employment type, and time period.

## Skills Demonstrated
1. Data Cleaning & Transformation: Power Query was used to preprocess the dataset, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
2. Data Analysis Techniques: Pivot Tables and Charts were used to summarize data effectively.
3. Interactive Dashboard Design: Designed a user-friendly dashboard for filtering and visual exploration.
4. Storytelling with Data: Conveyed insights with visually appealing and intuitive charts.

## Data Overview
The dataset comprised 38 fields, including:

1. Employee Demographics: id_employee, age, gender, marital status.
2. Job Details: job role, department, years at company.
3. Compensation: salary, hourly rate, percent salary hike.
4. Performance and Satisfaction: job satisfaction, work-life balance.
5. Tenure and Attrition: attrition, termination type, years since last promotion.

## Key Questions Addressed
This project explored 15 critical HR questions, including:
1. Employee Statistics: Total employees, current employees, terminated employees, and termination rate.
2. Salary Insights: Total salary paid and trends in salary distribution.
3. Employee Dynamics: New hires, terminations (quarterly and monthly).
4. Satisfaction Metrics: Job satisfaction and work-life balance by headcount.
5. Demographic Analysis: Gender distribution and educational qualifications.

## Visuals Used
Below are the key visuals incorporated into the dashboard:

### Cards
* Total Employees: 1,470
* Current Employees: 1,233
* Employees Terminated: 237
* Termination Rate: 19.22%
* Total Salary Paid: $8,424,768.00

### Line Chart
* Total Working Years and Salary by Gender.
Insight: Male employees with longer tenure earn higher salaries on average.
* Stacked Bar Chart
Quarterly New Hires: Visualized new hires per quarter.
Insight: Hiring spikes occurred in Q2, Q1 or Q3.
### Bar Charts
* Monthly Termination Trends.
* Termination on Quarterly Basis.
* Monthly Total Salary Trends.
* Education, Job Satisfaction, and Work-Life Balance by Headcount.
### Area Chart
* Years at Company by Salary.
Insight: Salaries increase steadily with tenure, peaking at year 2.
### Slicers
##### Filters: 
* Year (2008-2022)
* Employment Type (Contract/Full-Time)
* Department (R&D, Sales, HR).

## Results and Analysis
* Employee Statistics
  * Total Employees: 1,470 employees since inception.
  * Current Employees: 80.78% retention rate.
* Terminations: Attrition is highest among early-tenure employees.
* Salary Insights
  * Top Salary Trends: Salaries for long-tenure employees show the steepest growth.
  * Contract vs. Full-Time: Full-time employees earn 5x more than contractors.
* Employee Engagement
  * Satisfaction Scores: 65% rate satisfaction as “high” or “very high.
  * Work-Life Balance: Variance exists across departments, with HR scoring the lowest.
## Conclusion
This project provided a robust analysis of workforce dynamics. The interactive dashboard is a valuable tool for HR teams to:
1. Monitor key metrics such as attrition and satisfaction.
2. Optimize hiring and retention strategies.
3. Ensure salary fairness and competitiveness.
## Recommendations
1. Enhance Employee Engagement: Focus on improving satisfaction and work-life balance, especially in underperforming departments.
2. Optimize Hiring Strategies: Increase hiring during quarters with higher attrition rates.
3. Leverage Advanced Analytics: Integrate machine learning models to predict attrition.
